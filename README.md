## üì± Overview

Hotspot is a real-time, community-driven safety reporting mobile application that helps users stay aware of dangerous areas before they encounter them. Unlike navigation apps, Hotspot focuses purely on **safety awareness** through:

- üó∫Ô∏è **Real-time incident mapping** - Hijackings, muggings, and accidents displayed on an interactive map
- üö® **Quick one-tap reporting** - Report incidents in seconds with automatic GPS capture
- üîî **Geofenced hotspot alerts** - Get notified when entering high-risk zones
- üìä **Community verification** - Upvote reports to build trust and filter noise
- üìà **Safety analytics** - Understand when and where risks are highest

### üéØ Core Concept

Hotspot automatically creates **geofenced danger zones** when incidents cluster in an area. As you drive or travel, you receive real-time alerts:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Entering HIGH RISK Zone
15 Hijackings reported in this area in the past 7 days. Stay alert.
```

This is **not a navigation app** - it's a safety awareness tool that keeps you informed about your surroundings.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This monorepo contains three main applications:

```
HotSpota/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotspot_api/          # Backend API (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotspot_mobile/       # Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotspot_admin/        # Admin Portal (React + Vite) - Coming soon
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .kiro/specs/          # Technical specifications
```

### Applications

| Application | Technology | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Backend API** | Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL+PostGIS | REST API, WebSocket server, geospatial processing |
| **Mobile App** | React Native, Expo, MapLibre | iOS & Android app for end users |
| **Admin Portal** | React, Vite, TailwindCSS | Web dashboard for moderation and analytics |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- PostgreSQL 16 with PostGIS extension
- Redis 7.x
- iOS Simulator (Mac) or Android Studio
- Expo CLI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotspot.git
   cd HotSpota
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd hotspot_api
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Set up the mobile app**
   ```bash
   cd hotspot_mobile
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API URL
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Set up the admin portal** (Coming soon)
   ```bash
   cd hotspot_admin
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

See individual README files in each directory for detailed setup instructions.
