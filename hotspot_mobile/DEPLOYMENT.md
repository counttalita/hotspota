      "bundleIdentifier": "com.hotspot.app",
      "buildNumber": "1",
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "Hotspot needs your location to show nearby safety incidents and alert you when entering danger zones.",
        "NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription": "Hotspot needs background location access to alert you when entering hotspot zones even when the app is closed.",

```bash
eas login
```

### Initialize EAS

```bash
cd hotspot_mobile
eas build:configure
```

This creates `eas.json`:

```json

  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://api.hotspot.app",
        "WS_URL": "wss://api.hotspot.app/socket"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}

## Step 5: Set Up Push Notifications

### iOS (APNs)

1. In Apple Developer Portal:
   - Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
   - Keys ‚Üí "+" ‚Üí Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)
   - Download `.p8` key file
   - Note Key ID and Team ID

2. Upload to Firebase:

   - iOS app configuration ‚Üí APNs Authentication Key
   - Upload `.p8` file
   - Enter Key ID and Team ID

### Android (FCM)

1. Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. Copy Server Key
3. Add to backend environment variables:
   ```bash
   FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_server_key
   ```

## Step 6: Set Up Crash Reporting

### Sentry Integration

```bash
npm install @sentry/react-native
```

Configure in `App.js`:
```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  environment: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Step 7: Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates

EAS Update allows pushing updates without app store review:

```bash
# Configure
eas update:configure

# Publish update
eas update --branch production --message "Bug fixes"
```

Users get updates automatically on next app launch.

## Step 8: Monitor and Maintain

### Analytics

Integrate analytics:
```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/analytics
```

Track key metrics:
- Daily active users
- Incident reports per day
- Verification rate
- Crash-free rate
- Session duration

### App Store Optimization (ASO)

- Monitor keyword rankings
- A/B test screenshots
- Respond to reviews
- Update regularly (every 2-4 weeks)

### Version Updates

When releasing new version:

1. Update version in `app.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.1.0",
     "ios": { "buildNumber": "2" },
     "android": { "versionCode": 2 }
   }
   ```

2. Build and submit:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform all --profile production
   eas submit --platform all --profile production
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check EAS build logs:
```bash
eas build:list
eas build:view <build-id>
```

Common issues:
- Missing credentials: Run `eas credentials`
- Native module errors: Clear cache and rebuild
- Memory issues: Upgrade EAS plan

### App Rejected

Common rejection reasons:
- Missing privacy policy
- Incomplete app description
- Crashes on launch
- Inappropriate content
- Missing required screenshots

Fix issues and resubmit.

### Push Notifications Not Working

1. Verify FCM/APNs credentials
2. Check device permissions
3. Test with Expo push notification tool:
   ```bash
   npx expo-notifications-test
   ```

## Cost Estimation
